# dotfiles

You know what this is.

### Dependencies

- arch Llnux
- xorg
- bash
- xmonad
- xmobar
- termite
- git
- powerline fonts (from the AUR, NOT the official repos)
- vim + plugins

### Install guide

Those are only configuration files, so no heavy lifting is required.
The script `install.sh` creates all the necessary symbolic links. If one of those files already exists on your computer, it will fail.
